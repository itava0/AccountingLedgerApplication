# Accounting Ledger Application

This application is a simple command-line Accounting Ledger application. The application 
will have a CLI user interface that is the front for users to track all financial 
transactions for business or personal use.

One of the features that I'm most proud of in my code is the navigation system. It lets the user easily switch between different home screens
and explore the online store. This makes the user experience more engaging and fun, as they can discover new products and offers. 
I also like how I organized the code to make it easy to read and modify. I used clear names for the variables and functions and added comments to explain the logic behind each step.
